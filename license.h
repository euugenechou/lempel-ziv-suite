// For him that stealeth this code and name it as his own let it change to a
// serpent in his hand and rend him. Let him be struck with palsy, and
// all his members wither. Let him languish in pain, crying aloud for
// mercy and let there be no surcease to his agony till he sink to
// Dissolution. Let worms gnaw his entrails in token of the worm
// that dieth not, and when at last he goeth to his final punishment
// let the flames of hell consume him.
